# Brief History of the Terminal

## 1990 - 2100
At the end of the 20th century the first interconnected network was created on the planet Earth which later developed into the so called "Internet". Adaption quickly happened on a global level and various communication solutions were created. Information exchange usually happened on so called "websites" and there was a competitive market between them.

In the early days of the 21st century so called "social media sites" dominated the public and private life. Multiple attempts of the companies behind those sites to take over the governmental process ended abruptly when in 2052 the "Regulated Information Law" was created. Most of those companies vanished shortly after. 

## 22nd century
In the middle of the 22nd century humans started to explore the sol system and quickly discovered that their old form of information presentation is no longer doable. 

Inspired by modern space craft user interfaces, soon a trend developed that focused only on the required information. The first Terminal was born. However the early Terminals were still constrained by old communication technologies and philosophies. Early Terminals looked very similar to their 21st century counterparts of websites containing a high amount of advertisment and operated 

At the end of the 22nd century an engineer named Arnes Lark came up with a new concept using sub space to transmit information. First prototypes were promising allowing to transmit information almost instantly throught the entire sol system. As time progressed Lark's implementations were found to become the standard in communication and security.

## 23rd century

That however changed when in 2371 when a group of hackers out of the Centauri system successfully were able to change subspace communication packages. They quickly manipulated the markets throughout many human inhabited systems creating havoc in almost everything. Communication at that time was still regarded as a commercial endevaour and jurisdication was scattered. This single event lead eventually to the creation of the United Nations of Earth (UNE) just nine years later.

The UNE quickly imposed standardization throughout the systems on all human habited worlds which once again lead to a revolution of technological design and adaption. The Terminal concept became more widespread as space farer requested to have access to their information everywhere in UNE controlled space.

## 24th - 29th century

Throughout the centuries many forms of Terminals developed. At around 2874 a new design scheme was introduced by the DeepSpace Exploration and Resources Community also known as DERC. They called it the Operations Terminal System Software or OTRM.

DERC and it's members were operating on many locations throughout the habitated worlds and eventually found themselves in need of having a universal systems across all locations available - allowing their members to access their personal and commercial data in trusted places. 

OTRM was simple in the beginning but eventually used by the UEE as blueprint across all corporations and affiliates.

## 30th century

In 2951 DERC released with the blessing of the UEE the OTRM software to the all citizens and organizations allowing them to build and create their own terminal implementions using the same trusted standards that have been employed for over a hundred years.
